Thanks for using this installer!

You will need: A device running Microsoft Windows, the latest version of Python. You can download Python from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To begin, double-click the 'InstallPackages.bat' file. This will install the required packages to download everything.
Once the InstallPackages.bat file closes, run the InstallServer.py file. This will install everything you need to run
your server. Put any mods you want into the 'mods' folder. 

Once done, you can double-click the 'StartServer.bat' file to run your server!

---Additional Options---
Once the 'StartServer.bat' file has downloaded, you can change the value of the number after '-Xmx' to specify how much
RAM you want to use. E.G. If I wanted an 8GB server, I would change it to '-Xmx8192M' or '-Xmx8G'. Recommended to use 
at least 2GB RAM. 

1024M - 1GB
2048M - 2GB
3072M - 3GB
4096M - 4GB
5120M - 5GB
6144M - 6GB
7168M - 7GB
8192M - 8GB
